## FAQ
**Q:** Will Demailer show all unread messages in my inbox on startup?

**A:** No! Demailer searches messages with `(NEW)` IMAP status â€“ this returns only those messages that weren't received by any of the email clients beforehand. 

##
**Q:** Does Demailer mark my messages as read upon notifying?

**A:** Again, no chance! Demailer only removes the `(NEW)` status from the message, they will remain unread until you actually read them in your favourite email client.
